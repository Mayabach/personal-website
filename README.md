#Opening Instructions:
Please double-click on **index.html** *(I am using some bootstrap so an internet connection is a must).*

##The input validation:
Checking all fields are filled out in the contact form, checking the phone number is valid, the email is in email format and with a js function, that the message is longer than 5 chars.

##Bootstrap usage:
1. I used a bootstrap template for the navbar which at first had links to 2 things, a search bar and an expand option when media screen is decreased.
I mostly used it for the expanding function for smaller media, I added a button (dark mode) and changed the expanding button to different images, I removed a button and added the links to the relevant places in my site.

2. I also used bootstrap for the footer, at first it had some icons that are centered and change color when hovered on. I changed all the icons using svgs from the web and changed the hover method to remove a filter rather than change the color of the icon as it helped with the Gmail icon.


##Javascript Code:
The Javascript code I wrote has multiple functions:
1. Darkmode: makes the whole website change to a darker version.
2. Generating a mail: using the form (which opens up when you click on the gmail button in the footer) to create a mail.
3. Input validation: I mentioned earier.
4. Opening and closing the contact form.
